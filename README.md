# Eleventy + Netlify CMS Boilerplate

Eleventy in a Box is a reusable Eleventy starter for blogs, brochure websites, and small editorial projects.
Optional add-on feature packs are available so you can add extra functionality when needed.

## What’s included

- Eleventy v3
- Netlify CMS admin at `/admin/`
- Neutral starter content and placeholder assets
- Feature-pack system for optional modules

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Developing

```bash
npm run start
```

The development server runs at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Building

```bash
npm run build
```

Static files are written to `dist/`.
The build now clears `dist/` first, so stale output is removed automatically.

## Feature Packs

The base boilerplate is intentionally minimal.
Optional sections (for example, blog, FAQs, portfolio, and team) can be added as feature packs.
Reusable interface patterns, including alternate navigation treatments, can also be installed as packs.

- Feature flags are in `features.json`
- Pack code lives in `feature-packs/<name>/`
- Drop-in content/layout starter files live in `feature-packs/<name>/files/`
- Feature styles can live in `feature-packs/<name>/files/src/css/<name>.css` and are loaded only when enabled

You can preview changes without writing files:

```bash
node scripts/add-feature.js team --dry-run
node scripts/add-feature.js blog --dry-run
node scripts/add-feature.js case-studies --dry-run
node scripts/add-feature.js changelog --dry-run
node scripts/add-feature.js faqs --dry-run
node scripts/add-feature.js navigation-menus --dry-run
node scripts/add-feature.js portfolio --dry-run
node scripts/add-feature.js services --dry-run
node scripts/add-feature.js testimonials --dry-run
```

You can remove a pack the same way:

```bash
npm run remove:blog
npm run remove:case-studies
npm run remove:changelog
npm run remove:faqs
npm run remove:navigation-menus
npm run remove:portfolio
npm run remove:services
npm run remove:testimonials
npm run remove:team
```

The removal script:

1. Disables the pack feature flag in `features.json`
2. Removes installed pack files from `src/`
3. Removes manifest-driven navigation items
4. Removes CMS entries defined by the pack

By default, modified installed files are left in place. Use `--force` only when you want to remove those as well.

## Auditing

```bash
npm run check:boilerplate
npm run check:css
```

This checks the feature-pack wiring for:

1. Required pack files
2. Matching add/remove package scripts
3. Feature flags
4. Navigation entries
5. CMS fragments
6. Disabled packs that are still installed in `src/`

The CSS audit checks for:

1. `transform` shorthand usage
2. Undefined `data-layout` names in templates
3. Pack CSS files that are not wired through `head.html`
4. CSS links in `head.html` that do not point to a real pack stylesheet

## Content Model

- `src/index.md`: homepage
- `src/about.md`: about page
- `src/contact.md`: contact page
- `src/_data/site-content.json`: editable site content for the CMS
- `src/_data/site.js`: computed site data and environment-aware URL logic
- `src/_data/navigation.json`: main navigation
- `src/_data/footer_navigation.json`: footer navigation

## Layout system

Layouts use city names in `data-layout` and can change grid rhythm with `data-grid`.
The default rhythm is `4-5`.

```html
<div class="layout" data-layout="berlin">
```

Switch the same city recipe onto another compound grid:

```html
<div class="layout" data-layout="berlin" data-grid="4-6">
```

Available grid rhythms are `4-5`, `4-6`, and `3-4`.
The `4-6` rhythm shares the same named lines as `4-5` where possible, while `3-4` has a compact override layer for city recipes that need fewer `b` lines.

## Naming conventions

### Images

Use these names unless a pack has a specific reason not to:

- `featureImage`: page-level hero or lead image
- `featureImageCaption`: optional caption for `featureImage`
- `image`: main item image when the pack is not already using an established field name
- `thumbnail`: list or card image when the pack is not already using an established field name
- `avatar`: person image
- `logo`: brand or company mark
- `clientLogo`: client-specific logo inside case studies or similar work content

Keep new aliases to a minimum. Reuse an existing name when the meaning is already clear.

### Data

For index pages and content entries, prefer these fields where they fit:

- `title`
- `metaDesc`
- `lede`
- `summary`
- `order`
- `featured`
- `slug`

Editable site-wide content belongs in `src/_data/site-content.json`.
Computed values such as `absoluteUrl` and `assetPath` belong in `src/_data/site.js`.

## Netlify CMS

The CMS is configured for Git Gateway on the `main` branch. Before launching a real site:

1. Edit `src/_data/site-content.json` or use the CMS Globals section for contact details.
2. Replace the starter copy with project content.
3. Enable Netlify Identity and Git Gateway in your Netlify project.

## Productising this boilerplate

If you want to package this starter as a commercial product, see [docs/sellable-boilerplate-checklist.md](docs/sellable-boilerplate-checklist.md).
It includes a practical launch checklist and the first files to tighten before charging for it.
